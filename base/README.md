# base

Bits and pieces for building (the infrastructure of) a clojure
project. In particular:

- Some stdlib stuff
- A sane dev logging config that you can override by putting a
  logback.xml into your classpath

## Usage

Add `[webnf/base "0.0.9"]` to your lein project and require away.

## FIXME

Utilize cljx: Some of these bits should also be available on clojurescript.
