# webnf/cljs

This is the bits-and-pieces project for ClojureScript.
There is some good stuff in there, check it out:

- A promise implementation based on core.async
  For when you really want that always-latest readport
- Event delegation (why is this not in google closure?)
- A jQuery interface without having a static mapping of jQuery methods
- log, log-pr to browser console, log-pr is set as default *\*print-fn\**
- xhr based on core.async
- url(enc/dec)-parameters (why is this not in gclosure?)

## FIXME

The algorithmic stuff from base should also be available in ClojureScript
